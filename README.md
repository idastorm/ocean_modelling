# Ocean Voyage Model üåç

The Ocean Voyage tool has been developed in collaboration with researchers from Ohio State University and the Centre for Digital Humanities and the Swedish Rock Art Research Archives at the University of Gothenburg.

This prototype allows for simulating sea routes anywhere on the globe during different seasons, and can be used to model the voyages of different ship types at potentially any time in history. It is based on open source data on sea currents and wind collected by [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) (European Union's Earth Observation Programme) and [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).
