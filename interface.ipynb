    "# Ocean Voyage Model üåç\n",

    "The Ocean Voyage tool has been developed in collaboration with researchers from Ohio State University and the Centre for Digital Humanities and the Swedish Rock Art Research Archives at the University of Gothenburg.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prototype allows for simulating sea routes anywhere on the globe during different seasons, and can be used to model the voyages of different ship types at potentially any time in history. It is based on open source data on sea currents and wind collected by [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) (European Union's Earth Observation Programme) and [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)."

    "## Instructions\n",
    "For more information on JupyterHub and Jupyter Notebooks, please refer to the supplemental material in this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use the tool, click the cell above and press \"‚ñ∂ Run\" in the upper toolbar. A map should appear. \n",
    "2. To zoom in, double-click or press the \"+\". To zoom out, press the \"-\". To restore, press the \"View full screen\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run a simulation, the following parameters must be set:\n",
    "\n",
    "### On the map:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter a region where to simulate the vessels with \"Draw a rectangle\". All simulations will be restricted by this region, and stop at its borders.\n",
    "2. Enter a number of departure points inside the rectangle with \"Draw a circlemarker\". Departure points outside of the rectangle will be ignored.\n",
    "2.5. If you wish to simulate sailing towards a target, place a target location for the vessels with \"Draw a marker\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the date range:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select a time interval to launch the vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In simulation specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set the launch interval. This is the frequency with which new vessels will be launched. E.g. 5 means a new vessel is sent every 5 days.\n",
    "5. Set the max journey length. This determines how long we allow vessels on the ocean before they \"drown\".\n",
    "6. Set the timestep. The timestep determines the resolution of the trajectories, and denotes the interval at which we calculate the new velocity. A lower timestep causes the simulation to run longer.\n",
    "7. Set the displacement type. Choose either *drift* or *sailing*. The former defines a vessel drifting in the sea, while the latter defines a vessel travelling towards a target.\n",
    "8. Choose a vessel type.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. To run the simulation, click the \"Run simulation\" button."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface calls a numerical model in the background, called *Voyager*, which is a so called *agent-based model*, where each trajectory is calculated by vessel objects traversing a map, where the speed and direction of the vessels is determined by the vessel type, the kind of displacement, and most importantly real world data on current and wind fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical model\n",
    "The movement on the map is calculated in great circle coordinates, assuming a relatively flat Earth, and then converted into latitude and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drift model\n",
    "The movement in east-west ($x$) and south-north ($y$) can be summarised as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x \\leftarrow x + v_x \\Delta y $$\n",
    "$$ y \\leftarrow y + v_y \\Delta y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_x, v_y$ are the velocities in both directions, and $\\Delta t$ is the timestep parameter. The velocities are calculated from the wind and current fields and parameters depending on the vessel type. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sailing model\n",
    "The sailing model is a modification of the drift model with directed traversal, that is, travelling towards a target. Mathematically, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x \\leftarrow x + (v_x + v_{T,x}) \\Delta x $$\n",
    "$$ y \\leftarrow y + (v_y + v_{T,y}) \\Delta y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_{T,x}, v_{T,y}$ is a \"pushing\" velocity towards the target."
